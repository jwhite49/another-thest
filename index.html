        <p>I am a <strong><span style="color: rgb(224, 15, 15);">student-athlete</span></strong> from Wellington, Florida who just graduated from Wellington High School. I am currently studying computer science at Jacksonville University while also playing D1 softball.<br> I am very committed to my team and my academics. I am a great leader in the classroom and on the field. Always working towards a personal goal.</p>
        <p>I haven't currently decided what field of software development I would like to pursue. Game developing is currently on my list of possibilities as well as working for a tech company. My options are very<br> open and willing to strive for the best in any company I work for. </p>
        <p>I have great <strong><span style="color: rgb(224, 15, 15);">leadership</span></strong> skills in the classroom and on the field. Experience with constant hard work and impeccable <strong><span style="color: rgb(224, 15, 15);">communication</span></strong> skills from 10 years of playing competitive softball. Always pushing<br> myself to succeed further.</p>
